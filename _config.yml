  Hi! The name's Noom. I'm a full-stack developer. I mainly make websites and some DevOps. I co-created [Eventpop](https://eventpop.me), an end-to-end platform for events & activities. My personality type (according to [MBTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myersâ€“Briggs_Type_Indicator)) is INTJ.

  # Write an awesome description about yourself here, this supports markdown, so you can add [links](http://foobar.com) and highlight things <mark>like this</mark>.

  # You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else markdown supports such as
  #   - Lists
  #   - Tables
  #   - Links
  #   - Images

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
