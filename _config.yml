  Hi! The name's <mark>Noom</mark>. I'm a full-stack developer. I mainly make websites and some DevOps. I co-created [Eventpop](https://eventpop.me), an end-to-end platform for events & activities. My personality type (according to [MBTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myersâ€“Briggs_Type_Indicator)) is [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality)~[ISFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality). I'm eager to [learn everything](https://wiki.monosor.com). <mark>Productivity</mark> is my favorite word.

  I like to code in <mark>Ruby</mark>, <mark>Elixir</mark>, <mark>Javascript</mark>. I build with <mark>TDD</mark> methodology in mind.
